  "content": "Primary Structure: The primary structure of a protein refers to the linear sequence of amino acids in the polypeptide chain. This sequence is determined by the genetic code and forms the foundation for all higher levels of protein structure. The primary structure is held together by peptide bonds (covalent bonds) between adjacent amino acids. Secondary Structure: Secondary structure refers to local folding patterns within the polypeptide chain, stabilized by hydrogen bonds between the backbone atoms (not the side chains). The two most common types of secondary structure are Alpha Helices (Right-handed spiral structures where the backbone forms a helix, with hydrogen bonds forming between the carbonyl oxygen of one amino acid and the amide hydrogen of an amino acid four residues away) and Beta Sheets (Extended strand-like structures where adjacent strands are held together by hydrogen bonds between backbone atoms. Beta sheets can be parallel or antiparallel). Tertiary Structure: Tertiary structure describes the overall three-dimensional shape of a single polypeptide chain. It results from interactions between amino acid side chains (R groups) that may be far apart in the primary sequence but close in the folded structure. Forces stabilizing tertiary structure include Hydrogen bonds between side chains, Ionic bonds (salt bridges) between charged side chains, Van der Waals forces between nonpolar side chains, and Disulfide bonds between cysteine residues. Quaternary Structure: Quaternary structure refers to the arrangement of multiple polypeptide chains (subunits) in proteins that contain more than one chain. Examples include hemoglobin (4 subunits) and antibodies (4 subunits). The same types of interactions that stabilize tertiary structure also hold quaternary structures together.",
