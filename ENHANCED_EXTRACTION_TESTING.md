# Enhanced Content Extraction Testing Guide

## üéØ What We Fixed

The core problem was that the Chrome extension was only capturing page headers/navigation instead of the actual detailed content. We've completely restructured the content extraction to capture:

1. **Full Page Content**: Title, all headers, main content areas
2. **Intelligent Scanning**: Priority-based extraction with fallbacks  
3. **Better Chunking**: Preserves content structure in the knowledge base
4. **Direct Upload**: Now uploads to knowledge base instead of just analyzing

## üîß Changes Made

### Chrome Extension (`chrome_extension_updated/content.js`):
- **Enhanced `extractPageContent()`**: Now uses multi-selector priority approach
- **Structured Extraction**: Captures title, headers, main content, metadata
- **Updated Button**: "üì§ Upload Page to Knowledge Base" (instead of analyze)
- **Comprehensive Scanning**: Falls back to full page scan if primary content not found
- **Better Error Handling**: Detailed feedback and troubleshooting tips

### Backend (`src/api_server.py`):
- **Intelligent Chunking**: Better content preservation with section-aware splitting
- **Enhanced Metadata**: More detailed content tracking
- **Improved Logging**: Better debugging information

## üß™ Testing Steps

### Step 1: Install Enhanced Extension
1. Go to Chrome Extensions (`chrome://extensions/`)
2. Enable "Developer mode"
3. Click "Load unpacked"
4. Select the `chrome_extension_updated` folder
5. Make sure the old extension is disabled/removed

### Step 2: Test Content Extraction
1. **Clear Knowledge Base**: 
   ```powershell
   Invoke-RestMethod -Uri "https://cucov2-production.up.railway.app/clear-knowledge-base" -Method DELETE
   ```

2. **Go to Study Guide 4 Page** on Canvas
3. **Make sure all content is visible/expanded** on the page
4. **Click the ü§ñ button** in the floating panel
5. **Click "üì§ Upload Page to Knowledge Base"**
6. **Look for detailed success message** showing chunks created, processing time, etc.

### Step 3: Verify Content Was Captured
1. **Check the monitoring dashboard**: https://cucov2-production.up.railway.app/
2. **Test specific questions**:
   ```powershell
   # Test protein structure content
   $headers = @{'Content-Type' = 'application/json'}
   $body = @{question = "What are the four levels of protein structure?"} | ConvertTo-Json
   Invoke-RestMethod -Uri "https://cucov2-production.up.railway.app/ask-question" -Method POST -Headers $headers -Body $body
   
   # Test enzyme content  
   $body = @{question = "Explain enzyme kinetics and Michaelis-Menten"} | ConvertTo-Json
   Invoke-RestMethod -Uri "https://cucov2-production.up.railway.app/ask-question" -Method POST -Headers $headers -Body $body
   
   # Test specific terms
   $body = @{question = "What is a disulfide bridge?"} | ConvertTo-Json
   Invoke-RestMethod -Uri "https://cucov2-production.up.railway.app/ask-question" -Method POST -Headers $headers -Body $body
   ```

### Step 4: Debug if Issues Persist
If content still isn't captured:

1. **Check Browser Console**: Look for extraction logs
2. **Try the diagnostic tool**:
   ```powershell
   python test_specific_content.py
   ```
3. **Verify page structure**: The extension logs what content sources it finds

## üîç What to Expect

### Success Indicators:
- ‚úÖ Upload shows "X chunks created" (should be multiple chunks for Study Guide 4)
- ‚úÖ AI can answer questions about protein structures, enzymes, etc.
- ‚úÖ Console shows "Found content from: Main Canvas user content" 
- ‚úÖ Content length should be 5000+ characters for Study Guide 4

### Problem Indicators:
- ‚ùå Only 1-2 chunks created with short content
- ‚ùå AI still says "cannot find that information"
- ‚ùå Console shows "No primary content found, using comprehensive scan"
- ‚ùå Content length under 1000 characters

## üöÄ Key Improvements

1. **Comprehensive Extraction**: No longer limited to basic selectors
2. **Structured Content**: Preserves titles, headers, and organization  
3. **Intelligent Fallbacks**: Multiple strategies to capture content
4. **Better User Feedback**: Clear success/failure messages with details
5. **Enhanced Chunking**: Preserves content relationships in vector search

The system should now capture the full Study Guide 4 content including all the protein structure details you showed me!
