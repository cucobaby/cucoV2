1. Primary Structure: The linear sequence of amino acids in a protein chain, connected by peptide bonds.

2. Secondary Structure: Local folding patterns including:
   - Alpha helixes: spiral structures stabilized by hydrogen bonds
   - Beta sheets: extended strands forming sheet-like structures

3. Tertiary Structure: The overall 3D shape of a single protein molecule, determined by interactions between amino acid side chains (R-groups).

4. Quaternary Structure: The arrangement of multiple protein subunits to form a functional protein complex.

Additional protein concepts:
- Amino acids are the monomers that make up proteins
- Glycine is the simplest amino acid with R-group = H
- Protein folding is crucial for function
- Hydrophobic and hydrophilic interactions affect protein structure""",
