# Canvas AI Assistant - Simplified Approach

## How it Works Now

The extension has been **simplified** to remove complex link navigation and fetching logic. Here's how to use it:

### âœ… Simple Workflow

1. **Navigate manually** to any Canvas page you want to analyze:
   - Assignment pages
   - Discussion topics  
   - Course pages
   - Quiz pages
   - Study guides
   - Any Canvas content page

2. **Click the floating AI button** (ðŸ¤– AI Assistant) in the bottom right

3. **Click "Upload This Page to Knowledge Base"** - the big green button

4. **Ask questions** using the text area below

### ðŸŽ¯ Key Changes Made

- **Removed** complex link analysis buttons next to every Canvas link
- **Removed** automatic page fetching (which was blocked by Canvas security)
- **Simplified** to just one main upload button that works on the current page
- **Added** clear instructions in the panel
- **Enhanced** the UI to be more user-friendly

### ðŸ”§ To Test

1. Navigate to any Canvas page with content (like "Study Guide 2")
2. You should see the floating AI button
3. Click it to open the panel
4. Use the green "Upload This Page to Knowledge Base" button
5. The extension will extract content from the current page only
6. Ask questions about the uploaded content

### ðŸ’¡ Why This is Better

- **No Canvas security issues** - we only read the current page
- **Cleaner interface** - no confusing buttons everywhere  
- **Reliable functionality** - works consistently across Canvas
- **Clear user flow** - navigate â†’ upload â†’ ask questions

The extension now focuses on what works reliably rather than trying to overcome Canvas security restrictions.
